# mRNACalc
mRNA extinction coefficient and concentration calculator.

This webserver provides a tool for calculating the extinction coefficient (ε260) for RNA molecules with standard nucleobases (A,G,C and U), pseudouridine (Ψ), and N1-methylpseudoUridine (m1Ψ).
The parameters for calculating the ε260 and molecular weight of an RNA can be found at the bottom of this webserver.
An experimental protocol is provided, along with the required calculating tools, for measuring the 260 nm absorbance of mRNAs and calculating mRNA concentrations.
This protocol for photometric measurement of RNA concentrations is based on the intrinsic absorptivity properties of single monophosphate nucleotides.
